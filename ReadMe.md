# Horizon Face

This project is for automatically collecting and analysing photos within a wechat chatgroup.

## Dependencies

1. [wxpy](http://wxpy.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/index.html) : serves as a robot to collect photos and reply messages
2. [mongoengine](http://docs.mongoengine.org/apireference.html) : provides interaction with the database
3. (private) C++ server: provides face detection and recognition
4. [Baidu Face API](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/FACE/Face-API.html#.E4.BA.BA.E8.84.B8.E6.A3.80.E6.B5.8B): provides face detection and attributes analysis

## Development

We provide development kit to parse text messages as commands that request some statistic data.
To develop your own parser, you could follow these steps:

1. Create a file in ``processors/`` folder (e.g. ``LikeTextProcessor.py``)
2. Declare a class as the subclass of TextProcessor:

```python
from TextParser import TextParser

class LikeTextProcessor(TextParser):
    def __init__(self):
        # register a reg-expression here for the command
        super(LikeTextProcessor, self).__init__(r'@(.*)\s最中意谁')
        
    def process(self, match):
        # match is the match for the reg-expression
        
        # DO your statistics
        
        self.msg.reply('your reply text')
        self.msg.reply_img('your image path') # you can get some image from the database and edit it with cv2
```

3. Register the class in the module init file ``processors/__init__.py`` by first import it and then add the name to ``__all__`` array.

```python
from .LikeTextProcessor import LikeTextProcessor

__all__= [
    'LikeTextProcessor',
]
```

4 Test your code by running

```bash
$ python3 main.py
```

and input your test command.

## Database

The database format is as declared in ``models.py``.

### ``PictureCollections``
One document in this collection corresponds to one uploaded image.

```date``` field is the upload time.

```user``` field is the photographer (wechat name).

```md5``` field is used to exclude duplicate images.

```img``` field is the raw image in binary.

``stats`` field is the raw json of the analysis result, such as:

```json

```
``stats`` may not exist because no analysis results are provided.
The result in ``stats.result`` may not contain attributes, and the ``identity`` may be empty string because the face is not recognized.

### ``Users``

This is mainly for querying the user name according the the identity.

```python
identity = "kai.yu"
try:
    user = Users.objects.get(identity=identity)
    print(user.name)
except Users.DoesNotExist:
    pass

```

### ```Occurences```
Shame that this collection name is a typo...

The occurrences of people.

``identity`` can be "unknown".

Attributes related fields may be empty, but ``location`` and ``img`` always exists.

## Important

PLEASE test with ``main.py`` rather than ``bot.py`` which is for production use, because frequent request of wechat login may cause account locking!!!
